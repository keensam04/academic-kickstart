With an overall experience of 6 years in software development and application engineering, I almost fulfil the 10,000 hour rule. But I still consider myself a student of technology rather than an expert. 

In the several years I have had the chance to work on different aspects of enterprise software including front-end (not so much), middleware and storage. I grew fond of Java in my early years and ran with it for a while. I was fortunate enough to get exposure to distributed computing soon enough and got my hands dirty with real-time pipelines leveraging Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, etc.

During this time, I had been working on ingestion pipeline for timeseries data which would then be used for analytics. Curious as I was, I wanted to try out analytics and got into data science. 

The below image best describes me as a data scientist
