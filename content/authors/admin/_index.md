Started my professional career with SAP Labs India in 2014. I joined as a Scholar@SAP (work integrated learning program) straight out of college. I had the opportunity to work on various aspects of enterprise software from front-end to storage and middleware layers while rotating across SAP business areas. At the same time, I was studying DS, algo, design patterns, usability engineering, etc. as part of M.Tech curriculum. Coming from a non-CS (ECE) background, this was a perfect mix that helped shape my understanding of the software world.

In college days I was into embedded systems. IoT team at SAP was thus my go-to team. This was my next leap. I joined the team expecting to work on hardware-software combination, but ended up working on cloud-based platform for IoT devices. This broadened my awareness on the vastness of software engineering.

I started out with writing REST services for modelling real world devices into the platform and gradually moved to storing and managing live data from devices. Past my fancy for embedded systems, I took a plunge into big data. Formally, I worked on timeseries ingestion where i had the chance of working with distributed systems like Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, lambda architecture, etc.

Having worked with big data for a while, I got interested in its applications (predictive maintenance, forecasting, etc.). This led me to join the PG diploma course in ML&AI which has been quite engaging since. My responsibilities at current organisation enables me to practice my learnings on real-world business problems thus helping me learn better.

I crave to be an aficionado of technology and am a strong believer in the following quote by Scott Adams:\
"Technology will definitely solve all our problems, but in the process it will create brand new ones. But that's O.K. Because the most you can expect from life is to get to solve better and better problems"
